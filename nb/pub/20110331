/dis/redoer: Don't rebuild if a file’s current sum is different than a
sum which redo stored.  In ordinary practice, a derived file will not
change between runs of redo.  If the derived file has changed, then it
has been changed by hand, which redo should not undo.

To force redo to regenerate (and write over) a changed file, remove
the derived file, or remove the sum file of the derived file,
or update the sum file with the sum of the derived file’s new content,
or revert the file to its summed content.

This also means you can prevent redo from rebuilding a derived file:
in its sum file, set the checksum for the derived file to 0.
