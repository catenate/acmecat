This project publishes a variety of scripts and programs I wrote while  
working in Acme SAC,¹ and the public part of my technical notebook.  
Each directory tree starts at the root directory set while in Acme.²  
 ¹ Acme SAC is a Windows/Linux/Mac port of the Acme editor, the  
Inferno virtual machine, and essential unix-like tools derived through  
Plan 9.  
 ² For the latest Windows distribution, the root directory is the  
acme-0.13 subdirectory created when you unzip acme-0.13.zip from  
http://code.google.com/p/acme-sac/downloads/list  

dis contains shell scripts, and a version of acme.dis with a white  
grid instead of black.  

lib/do contains template script and dependency files for mkdo.  

lib/sed contains sed scripts files for filters in dis which pipe input  
directly through them.  

nb/nbindexes lists directories dis/nb should consult for indexes.  

nb/pub contains the public part of my technical notebook, indexed  
with the script dis/nb.
